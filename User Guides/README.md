## The Insights
Here's a list of all the insights that we've published in your Insights Dashboard

### Visitor Engagement Analysis

![Visitors Engagement Insight](https://inncee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Visitor-engagement-insight.png)

This insight looks at all the pageviews received by your store and calculates what percentage of those pageviews were for your product pages. 

It has been analyzed that a majority of visitors will only purchase a product after viewing the finer details of the product. Therefore measuring how many of the pageviews generated by visitors were for your product pages (which contain all the finer details) are a good indication of how interested the visitors are in the products you're offering. 

### Add-to-cart Analysis

![Add To Cart Analysis](https://inncee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/add-to-cart-insights.png)

This insight looks at the percentage of visitors that had added an item to cart and which products are getting a lot of visitors but no further actions were taken by the visitors.

Since the purchase process involves visitors entering the website, viewing a product page, adding a product to cart and then ultimately checking out, this analysis allows us to look at which products are failing at the add to cart step. 

### Abandoned Cart Rate Analysis

![Abandoned cart analysis](https://inncee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/abandoned-cart-insight.png)

The abandoned cart rate insight looks at whether you're seeing improvements in your abandoned cart recovery efforts or not. 

### Products to cross-sell

![](https://inncee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/products-frequently-sold-bestsellers.png)

This insight tracks the products that were frequently sold with your top 10 bestsellers over the last 3 months. It looks for products that it can identify as ideal cross-sell candidates which you can then use to help increase encourage visitors to buy more at each checkout.
